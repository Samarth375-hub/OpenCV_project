# üí° Professional Lighting Effects Editor

A powerful image editing application that allows you to apply professional lighting effects to your photos using OpenCV and Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Lighting Effects**:
  - Spotlight: Create a focused light source at a specific point
  - Vignette: Darken the edges while keeping the center bright
  - Light Rays: Simulate beams of light (God Rays)
  - Light Leaks: Add colorful light streaks for a vintage film look
  - Lens Flare: Simulate light scattering within camera lens
  - Color Temperature: Adjust warmth/coolness of the image
  - Dramatic Shadows: Enhance dark areas for a moody look
  - Glowing Highlights: Enhance bright areas for a dreamy look

- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Adjust effect parameters in real-time
  - Position effects with sliders
  - Compare before/after views
  - Save processed images with effect parameters documented

- **Professional Output**:
  - High-quality image processing
  - Side-by-side comparison images
  - Parameter documentation embedded in saved images

## üì∏ Example Effects

### Spotlight Effect
Creates a focused light source at a specific point in the image, simulating studio lighting.

### Vignette Effect
Darkens the edges of the image while keeping the center bright, drawing attention to the subject.

### Light Rays Effect
Simulates beams of light coming from a light source, adding a dramatic atmosphere.

### Lens Flare Effect
Simulates the scattering of light within the camera lens, adding a professional cinematic quality.
